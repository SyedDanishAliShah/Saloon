💇‍♂️💈 Saloon App – Your Smart Salon Booking Solution
Final Year Project - Android App
Developed during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic to promote safe and efficient salon bookings

📱 Overview
Saloon App is an innovative Android-based application designed to digitally transform how clients interact with salons—especially during health crises like COVID-19. This app was developed as part of a university final year project, with the core aim of reducing physical crowding in salons and promoting safer, contactless service bookings.

🎯 Purpose & Problem Solved
During the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, salons were a hotspot for crowding, making social distancing a challenge. The Saloon App was built to:

Help clients locate nearby salons easily via Google Maps.

Allow clients to book salon services in advance, selecting specific time slots.

Enable salons to manage their appointments and notify clients with confirmations—minimizing waiting lines and contact.

Ultimately, this solution reduces client overlap at salons, helping control the spread of COVID-19.

🔐 Login System
The app supports two types of users:

🧍 Client Login & Sign Up: Clients can register, log in, and view nearby salons.

👨‍💼 Admin/Salon Owner Login & Sign Up: Salon owners can manage bookings, view appointment requests, and confirm or reject slots.

🌍 Key Features
